# GyroscopeSystem-Arduino
Test bed for creating an operational drone controller. This uses an MPU-9250 gyroscope to light up the LED that would be in the best position to attempt to rotate the a drone back to gravity. Also can take inputs to change the angle of gravity if wanting to guide it.
Does not use PID controls.
